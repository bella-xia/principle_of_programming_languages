(*
  This file contains a few tests but not necessarily complete coverage.  You are
   encouraged to think of more tests if needed for the corner cases.
   We will cover the details of the test syntax but with simple copy/paste it should
   not be hard to add new tests of your own without knowing the details.
   1) Write a new let which performs the test, e.g. let test_assoc _ = ...
   2) Add that let-named entity to one of the test suite lists such as section1_tests
      by adding e.g.
       "Assoc"       >:: test_assoc;

   That's it! OR, even easier, just add another `assert_equal` to the existing tests.
   They will not be submitted with the rest of your code, so you may alter this file as you wish.

   Recall that you need to type "dune test" to your shell to run the test suite.

   open Fbdk.Options;;

   then type `peu <example>` to run the example <example>.

   this is the same as flag --show-messages on the binary. *)
(* show_messages := true;; *)

(* uncomment the following line to show the global state of the actor system as it evolves; 
   this is the same as flag --show-state on the binary. Actor names are @1 @2 etc here*)

(* Here is a very simple actor system: only one actor receiving one message 
   Note the code is the "bootstrap" code which just sets up the initial actor system
   It is not run by any particular actor.  To make an interesting actor system
   the bootstrap code needs to create at least one actor and send it at least one message.

let onemsg = "Let one_message_behavior =
  Fun me -> (* First parameter is by contract the address of this actor *)
  Fun data -> (* Second parameter is the initial state value in Create, 2 here *)
  Fun msg -> (* Third parameter is .. finally .. the message packet coming in *)
     Match msg With
       `doit(n) -> (Print \"OUTPUT: \"; (Print (n + data)); Print \"\n\");
                   Fun x -> x (* ignore this line for now, will explain later *)
In (* Above is just defining code, now lets bootstrap the system with some actual actors and messages *)
Let actor = Create(one_message_behavior,2) In
actor <- `doit(3)"
;;

(* peu onemsg will print OUTPUT: 5 *)

(* Note that parsing precedence is even worse in AFbV compared to previous languages!
   Moral: use many parentheses!! *)

(* Note if we send multiple messages to the above one_message_behavior actor 
   it will only process one of them (nondeterministically): *)

let multbad = "Let one_message_behavior = Fun me -> Fun data -> Fun msg ->
     Match msg With
       `doit(n) -> (Print \"OUTPUT: \"; (Print (n + data)); Print \"\n\");

actor <- `doit(7)"
;;
(* Nondeterminism is hard to debug so use this for debugging: `deterministic_delivery := true;;`
   - keeps message in a queue instead of a set conceptually *)


(* Why did the above not process 2nd message?  Because the contract is: when the actor is finished processing,
   it needs to return what code will use to process the next message.  Here that code is a no-op identity function.

   * This is similar to the hand-over-fist programming idiom for functional trees, lists, etc
   * But, it is not data state here, it is **code state**
   * In other words, the code you are setting is the future code for the actor
     - The PL term for "the rest of the code I need to run" is the **continuation**
     - So, each actor after processing one message needs to set its continuation before going back to sleep.
     - This is the same as how in JavaScript for asynchronous requests you need to set up the callback code
       -- the callback function is exactly the "next thing" the code needs to do, the **continuation**
       -- modern JavaScript has some sugar which hides this (asynch/await) but old JS and 
       under the covers there is a continuation function in JavaScript to perform subsequent actions
*)
   
(* Here is an example which processes multiple messages: 
  after the first message we **return code to process the second** -- the continuation code.  *)

  Fun me -> Fun data -> Fun msg ->
     Match msg With
       `doit(n) -> (Print \"OUTPUT: \"; (Print (n + data)); Print \"\n\");
     (* OK for the result we now return **code** (continuation) to process the next message *)
     (* This code is in turn what is installed in the soup so it will run upon next message *)  
     Fun msg -> ((Print \"DONE!\n\"); (Fun msg -> 0)) (* this return result will be code handling next message *)
    In
Let actor = Create(two_message_behavior,2) In

   install for subsequent messages is only Fun msg -> ... *)

(* To close the loop, here is actual code for something like the a1/a2 example we worked in class.  
   Recall the way it went:

   1) in the bootstrap code we created actors a1 and a2 and send a1 the message `hi(7)
   2) a1 handled the `hi(7) message, sending `ho(0) to a2
   3) a2 then replied `ok(0) to a1.

   Note that both a1 and a2 need to know each others' addresses; we can't in fact do that in the syntax
   of AFbV (it is a mutual self-reference) - !  So, here we do a minor variation where the bootstrap code
   makes a1 and send the `hi(7) message, and a1 then BOTH creates a2 and sends it a `ho(0) message.

(* The approach in the above examples of inlining next code fails if we want an actor to process unbounded messages.
